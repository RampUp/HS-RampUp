Hey SIB!

We are holding a session to introduce High Schoolers from across the Boston area to code on 4/27 and 5/4 and we have 80 students registered! 

Unfortunately, not all these students have access to laptops at home. We would like to allow them to participate in the program. 

So I wanted to reach out to you guys -- do you have an old laptop that you wouldn't mind us using for two Saturdays to teach a student how to code? If so, please email me (juliana@startupinstitute.com) or comment on this status and we can work out details. 

Thanks!

For those folks who couldn't make it down from Boston (and even those who did!) due to the lockdown, I'd love to get everyone together for a mini-ECSS, if you will.

If you're interested, leave your email in the comments and I'll organize something. Perhaps next Sunday (the 28th) we'll do brunch somewhere in Cambridge.

Peter, Albert, Nathaniel, Juliana, Thomas -- I know there were at least a dozen Boston guys/gals, so tag the rest!
Safe in Allston. Happy to be inside now

Thoughts and prayers going out to all the people at the Boston Marathon. And especially to all the Reston Runners who were there.

Tonight we are going to be meeting in the Learning Center, which is actually on the 6th floor at Atlantic Wharf (not the 7th).  To get there go to the 7th floor, pass the welcome desk as usual, and then go down the staircase.  Turn left and head down the hall.  The Learning Center will be on your left.

Its okay if you haven't finished the lab yet. Come work on the lab, ask questions, and start on projects if you want to.
If anyone wants the week 2 challenge, shoot me an email at Juliana@bostonstartupschool.com

Also, see you guys at BSS at 7pm on Thursday. Text me or Will if you need to be let in. (Will: 703-517-0066, Juliana: 703-801-7814)
2nd place at HackMIT! Check out our project -- themusicmap.herokuapp.com
(Not all at once though, server is a bit unstable)
18 hours later - maybe a half hour of sleep in total - we have a finished product!
Hey guys, for anyone looking for a mid-week coding challenge, we just posted one on the site. Give it a shot and let me know if you have any questions or want a harder challenge that involves working with Flask.
Hey guys,

If you like hackathons and are free anytime between Sat Feb 2, 8pm to Sun Feb 3, 4pm, we would love to have you be a code and/or design mentor at HackMIT. 

HackMIT (http://techfair.mit.edu/events/hackathon/) is the Boston area school's response to PennApps (http://2013s.pennapps.com/), a widely successful hackathon a few weeks ago. 

So, come hang out with BSS alums, eat free food, and help rookie coders and designers at HackMIT this weekend. If your interested, sign up here. (We need you to sign up so that we can put you on the list to let you into the Stata Center).

That awkward moment when Juliana is laughing at Brett recording me and slams her head into the wall.
